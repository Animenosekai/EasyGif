## What is EasyGif?
EasyGif is a simple bot which helps you send GIFs as quick as possible on Discord.
> Simply type `.gif <search term>` replacing `<search term>` with the theme of the gif you want to send.

But it has also cool features!
- Write `.gifrandom` to send a random GIF to the channel
- Write `.gifstats` to display your statistics on EasyGif
- Write `.gifchange` to change the last gif you sent with EasyGif *(yea if you didn't like it)*
- Write `.gifdelete` to delete the last gif you sent with EasyGif *(if you made an oopsie)*

## Development
EasyGif is in constant development and fixes are made on a regular basis (but I also try to add some new features ehe)

##### Dependencies
EasyGif won't live long without the help of its dependencies and awesome modules that others made, which includes:
- Requests *(To make HTTP requests to the different API EasyGif uses)*
> Can be installed using `PIP` (the python package manager) through the command: `pip install requests`
- Discord.py *(basically what makes the bot running and communicating with discord)*
> Can be installed using `PIP` through the command: `pip install discord.py`
- Firebase Admin SDK *(to manage the database)*
> Can be installed using `PIP` through the command: `pip install firebase-admin`
